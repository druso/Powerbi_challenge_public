# PowerBI challenge assistant 

This code was developed for 2023 PowerBI Challenge @Alkemy Consulting, this is a chatbot that supports the participants in the challenge with their doubts about the PowerBI file. But it does so with some twists.
The code also allows to use and test different LLM models and has an escalation system between models of different complexities depending on the user request.
